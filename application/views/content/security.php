 <h2>SecurityPolicy</h2>
 
 
	<p>Indiabiztrade.com is always reaching out to a wider audience by showcasing the best of our member contributions. However, in doing so, we will not allow to be uploaded anything on the site that we think could be potentially endangering or is inflammatory or embarrassing to our members. It also helps members to be aware of certain things in the interest of their safety.
All members are responsible for the safety of their personal information. We recommend that members do not disclose their personal information online.</p>
<p>
All members need to be aware that when they upload their photos to the site, the photos are not only visible to the entire internet community, but can also be downloaded, since any image that can be displayed on a computer screen can be saved by the person viewing it. It is technically not possible to prevent this and hence Indiabiztrade.com cannot be held liable in such cases. If you are worried about someone else viewing or saving your images, then please do not submit/share them.
Do not post chain letters, promote pyramid schemes or recruit members for any network marketing or multilevel marketing businesses.</p>
<p>
Do not recruit members to join website forums or chat groups, whether personal or otherwise. If you have a suggestion for a new forum, please contact us.</p>
<p>
Indiabiztrade encourages healthy discussion on the topics that members contribute to in the forums and where relevant, members are allowed to post links to their content. However, overt promotion of, or inappropriate links to other known commercial websites on any forum are not permitted and will be removed. If you are unsure whether a link or a posting is allowed, please send your queries to support@indiabiztrade.com. The definition of an appropriate link is one that is relevant to both the posting and the forum topic. A commercial site is considered as one which promotes a product or service for a price or for other consideration that suggests it is a for-profit business.
